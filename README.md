Toonification
=============

Converting an image into cartoon

> Specify the image in the code's folder
> chane the name of the loading image in the code Toonify.py
> Run it and voila

> Works good on many images and bad on few of them, I have included all around test cases.
> I am going to turn this into a GUI when I get the time to do so.
